# recommendation_algorithms


In this file, we implement four basic recommendation algorithms on 1M movielens dataset:

1- The Content-based algorithm that attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects

2- The user-based algorithm where the recommendation is computed as the weighted sum of the most similar users' ratings to the target item.

3- Recommender system based on users clustering (Kmeans) when the recommendation is computed based on the preferences of users belonging the same cluster

4- Recommender system based on items clustering (Kmeans) when the recommendation is computed based on 'the user's interest to items belonging to the same cluster
